# pair-programming-talk-exercise

This repo contains a purposefully unfinished [breakout clone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_clone).

The goal is to practice [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) with someone and implement the two collision functions in [main.js](./main.js). One person is the driver ("writer") for the `ballToPaddleCollisonCheck()` function and the other the navigator ("observer"). Then they switch roles for the `ballToBrickCollisonCheck()` function.

(this is for a pair programming talk I first gave in August of 2020)
